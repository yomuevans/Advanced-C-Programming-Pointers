# Advanced-C-Programming-Pointers
Welcome to this course on C programming with pointers. This document provides some additional information to assist you in using the course materials.

Information on this course

# COURSE LEVEL
This course is suitable for programmers with existing experience of programming in
C. It is not appropriate for beginners. I already have another course which is aimed
at beginner C programmers. Accordingly, I provide no explanations of the basics of
C programming and I assume that you already know how to edit, compile and run C
programs. You are free to use an editor or IDE on any desktop operating system.
However, I cannot provide any support related to specific IDEs or compilers.

# HOW TO USE THIS COURSE
The core learning materials in this course are the video lectures. If you are already a
fairly experienced programmer, you might want to skip the early lessons and go
straight to some of the more advanced topics. However, bear in mind that even the
early lessons help to explain some essential basics of pointers.
You should also download the source code archive. In addition, there are
some online quizzes to help test your understanding of the topics covered. The
quizzes provide information on the lessons that explain the details of specific
questions. If you have problems answering a question, I’d suggest that you re-watch
the specified video lessons.

# THE SOURCE CODE
The source code of all the examples shown in this course is supplied in a Zip archive
which you should download and extract. I’ve provided the code as a series of
projects that can be loaded into the free CodeLite editor. If you want the simplest,
fastest way to load and run the code, you may want to install CodeLite. You can
download a copy from www.codelite.org.

However, as this is an advanced level course, I am assuming that you are
already programming C and you’ll probably have your own favourite C editor.
That’s no problem: just create an empty C project in whatever editor you like, then
load my code into a text editor and copy and paste it into your C project.
The programs contain a lot of comments. So again, if you need some
clarification of exactly how the code works, reading the comments will probably be
helpful.
GOOD LUCK!
Pointers can be quite tough to understand and use safely in the initial stages. I hope
this course will help ease your way into understanding pointers. This really is an
important subject and a mastery of pointers will really set you apart from other
programmers. I hope you enjoy this course!
